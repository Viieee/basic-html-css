if an element have more than one type of selector that try to apply some styling
to it, ALL OF THEM WILL BE APPLIED!

but if the styling is conflicting between the selectors, 
for example in the font-size below:

****************************************
html:
<p id="author" class="author">
    Posted by <strong>Laura Jones</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027
</p>

css:
.author{
    font-size: 18px;
}

#author{
    font-size: 20px -> this one will be the one that 
}

p{
    font-size: 22px
}
****************************************

THE HIGHEST PRIORITY for the selectors are the id selector, if theres multiple id
selector, the last written on the css code will be the one applied

THE SECOND HIGHEST is the class selector, if theres multiple class
selector, the last written on the css code will be the one applied

THE THIRD PRIORITISED is the element selector, if theres multiple element
selector, the last written on the css code will be the one applied

THE LAST is universal selector (*) 

EXTRA NOTE:
theres some higher priority in css,
the highest priority is the declarations using !important 
example:
p { font-size: 18px !important; }

the second highest is the inline styling


-----------------------------------------------------------------

an element with pseudo class will be prioritised
example:

a:link{
  color: #0d7aa5; --> this will be the one that applied
}

a{
    color: red;
}
