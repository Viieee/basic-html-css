certain elements have meaning attached to them

not all elements in html have meaning
example:
b element and strong element will do similar things into it's content 
 which is making the text bold, but b element is not a semantic element 
 while the strong element is, because the name of the element gives 
 context into what it actually does and therefore have some type of meaning 
 behind it.

nav is also a semantic element, you can use div instead but nav will give more 
context into the elements nested in it

the reason why developers use semantic html is because it will give some type of 
advantage in the google search engine (because the search engine will be able to 
understand the structure of the website better in semantic html way)
